- when /video is requrestd from <video></video> tag request is made to server for video. 
- it will send  0-bytes Range as its starting of video

- once it reaches server it will send data in chunks through buffer & video plays untill bufer is 
    not empty.

- then it will keep on sending request to server for next chunk of data untill entire video is buffered into player.


- fs will help create file stream that go backs to client 
- range headers from client will required so that we can determine what range of video needs to be send
